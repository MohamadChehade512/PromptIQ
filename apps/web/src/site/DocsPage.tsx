            <p>
              The same request can produce a great answer or a useless one depending on how it’s
              asked. Prompt IQ checks a prompt before you send it, against what Anthropic, OpenAI
              and Google publish about getting good results from Claude, ChatGPT and Gemini. It then
              tells you what to fix and what the prompt will use in tokens, context window and cost.
            </p>
            <p>Prompt IQ has three parts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Docs</strong>: this guide.
              </li>

                <strong>Prompt Workshop</strong>: the tool for scoring and refining a prompt as you

          <section id="workshop">
            <h2>The Workshop</h2>
            <p>The Workshop is laid out in the order you’d use it:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Platform and use case.</strong> Choose Claude, ChatGPT or Gemini, and what
                the prompt is for: Q&amp;A, writing, coding, analysis, data extraction,
                brainstorming or summarization. The score and estimates follow that platform’s own
                guidance and pricing, and what a good prompt needs depends on the use case.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Your prompt.</strong> Everything updates as you type. Copy the result
                straight into your chat when you’re done.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Files, conversation and project access.</strong> Add files the prompt refers
                to, say how long the chat already is, and say whether the AI can already see your
                project.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Score and usage.</strong> Read the score, the suggestions, and the token,
                context and cost estimates.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <strong>Simple</strong> mode shows usage in plain terms for people using the chat
              apps. <strong>Advanced</strong> mode adds dollar costs, model and reasoning-effort
              choices, a per-area score breakdown and a multi-turn cost chart for API users.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="scoring">
            <h2>How scoring works</h2>
            <p>
              Each prompt gets a score out of 100, built from seven areas that the vendors’ guidance
              agrees matter:
            </p>
            <dl className="defs">
              <dt>Task clarity</dt>
              <dd>Is it clear what you want done, to what, and is the request complete?</dd>
              <dt>Context and intent</dt>
              <dd>
                Does the model know why you’re asking, who it’s for, and the material or details it
                needs?
              </dd>
              <dt>Output specification</dt>
              <dd>Does the prompt say what a good answer looks like: format, length, focus?</dd>
              <dt>Structure</dt>
              <dd>
                Is a longer prompt organised so instructions and material are easy to tell apart?
              </dd>
              <dt>Examples</dt>
              <dd>Where an example would help, is there one?</dd>
              <dt>Token economy</dt>
              <dd>Does every part earn its place, or is there filler and repetition?</dd>
              <dt>Platform fit</dt>
              <dd>Does it suit how the chosen platform and model work best?</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              How much each area counts depends on the use case. Examples matter more for data
              extraction than for brainstorming, for instance, and format matters more for
              extraction than for a quick question. Short, simple questions aren’t penalised for
              lacking the detail a long task needs.
            </p>
            <p>The score adapts to your situation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Follow-up messages</strong> are judged as part of a conversation, since the
                earlier messages already hold much of the context.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Attached files</strong> count as context only when the prompt says what to
                do with them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Project access mode</strong> stops asking for material the AI can already
                see, and checks for what a coding agent needs instead.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <table className="docs-table">

              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p className="note">
              The exact weights and checks behind the score are kept private, so the score stays a
              measure of good prompting rather than something to game.

          </section>

          <section id="suggestions">
            <h2>Suggestions and sources</h2>
            <p>
              Every suggestion says what’s missing, how to fix it, and roughly how many points it’s
              worth, so you can fix the biggest gaps first. Simple mode shows the top three.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each suggestion links to the published guidance it comes from: Anthropic’s, OpenAI’s
              and Google’s prompting documentation, plus recognised prompt-engineering references.
              If a vendor recommends something different for its platform, the suggestions follow
              that vendor.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="estimates">
            <h2>Tokens, context and cost</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Prompt tokens.</strong> ChatGPT counts are exact: OpenAI’s tokenizer runs in
                your browser. Claude and Gemini counts are close estimates, labelled “estimate”, and
                usually within about 10%. Exact counts for those two come once the Prompt IQ server
                is live.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Expected answer.</strong> A likely range for the reply, based on the use
                case and any length you asked for.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Thinking.</strong> For reasoning models, the hidden thinking the model does
                before answering, which is billed as output.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Context window.</strong> Prompt, files, earlier conversation, answer and
                thinking, compared with the model’s or plan’s limit. Every message resends the whole
                conversation, so long chats fill up and cost more per message.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cost.</strong> API users see dollars from each vendor’s published prices.
                Chat apps don’t charge per message, so Simple mode compares your message with a
                typical one instead.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Vendors change prices, limits and models often. Estimates are guidance, not bills.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="files">
            <h2>Files</h2>
            <p>
              You can attach PDFs, Word documents, images, and text or code files. They’re read in
              your browser and never uploaded. Prompt IQ works out how many tokens each file adds
              using each vendor’s published rules for documents and images. An image’s size, for
              example, decides its token cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              Files help the score only when the prompt uses them, as in “review the attached résumé
              for…”. A file the prompt never mentions, or one that doesn’t match the task, is
              flagged rather than rewarded.
            </p>

          <section id="projects">
            <h2>Coding tools and projects</h2>
            <p>
              Tools like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot and Codex, and Claude or ChatGPT
              Projects, can already see your files. Turn on <em>The AI can see my project</em> and
              Prompt IQ stops asking you to paste code. It checks instead that you’ve said where to
              look, what’s wrong or what should change, and how to check the result. This mode never
              gives a lower score than the same prompt without it.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="accuracy">
            <h2>How we test accuracy</h2>
            <p>
              Prompt IQ is tested against a library of real-world prompts across coding, writing and
              Q&amp;A, each graded by hand as weak, okay or strong. The score must agree with those
              grades and rank prompts in the same order. A separate set of prompts is never used for
              tuning, and checks how well the score handles prompts it hasn’t seen.
            </p>
            <p>
              These checks run automatically on every change, and an update isn’t published unless
              they pass.
            </p>
          </section>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Scoring and estimates run entirely in your browser. Your prompts and files aren’t
                sent to Prompt IQ, stored or logged.
              </li>
              <li>
                The name and email you give when agreeing to the terms are saved only in your
                browser, and you can delete them from the Workshop’s footer.
              </li>
              <li>
                The optional AI rewrite, when it launches, will send your prompt to Claude to
                rewrite it. It will always show the price and ask before running. File names are
                shared, never file contents.

                works without sending your prompt anywhere.
